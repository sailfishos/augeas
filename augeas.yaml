Description: |
    A library for programmatically editing configuration files. Augeas parses
    configuration files into a tree structure, which it exposes through its
    public API. Changes made through the API are written back to the initially
    read files.
    
    The transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
    details. It is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
    format and the transformation into a tree.
